 First, complete your WD-708a form and submit it to the desk 
 Sergeant:
   a) Type in your name and press Enter.
   b) Select a Case Level at which to play:
	[0] Detective = easy: 4 columns x 10 rows
	[1] Inspector = tricky: 5 columns x 12 rows
	[2] Chief Inspector = hard: 6 columns x 14 rows
   c) Select which game mode you wish to play:
	[0] Numbers = easy
	[1] Symbols = tricky
	[2] Words = hard
 You will then be given a new case to solve.

 To follow a lead, type in a number, symbols, letters or word
 and press ENTER to check it against the secret code. Think 
 carefully, as you must discover the code before your time
 runs out!

 The clues will show you if you have guessed any part of the 
 code correctly (o) or guessed correctly but placed it in the 
 wrong position (?) or didn't guess any part of it at all.

 The number of elements in the code for you to discover will
 be shown by blank boxes at the top of the board display. If 
 playing in Word mode, the code will always be a proper word.

 To ask for a hint, type [H] for an extra clue (3 per game).
 To resign from a case, type [Q] to set it as a "cold case".
 To end this again, type [R] for display game rules.

 Enjoy solving many interesting cases, Code Detective.
